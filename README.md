Content Management System -  command line app to manage company's database

# Summary of Project 

On this project we built a command line application using const mysql = require('mysql') to interact with node.js.  
const inquirer = require('inquirer') was used build the command line questions and provide a user imput to the application.  I found const chalk = require('chalk') to help change text color.  I also had to use const cTable = require('console.table') to help display the query results in the node.js app.
